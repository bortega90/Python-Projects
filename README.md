<h1>Balancing Checkbook</h1>
<p>In this project I used Python and Django framework to make a checkbook website that keeps track of deposits and withdrawals</p>

<p>This project I used sqlite 3 to create a database with files of different file types. I then pulled files that ends with a specific file type '.txt' from the database </p>
